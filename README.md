# The-Register-Article-Summarizer-GUI
The is an alternate version of https://github.com/LiterallyBlah/The-Register-Article-Summarizer but with a pretty GUI. You're able to list articles by 'Today', 'Last Week', and 'Last Month'. You're also able to filter the articles by tags. And finally, you can select multiple articles to summarise at a time.
